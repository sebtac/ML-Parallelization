    "# SEBTAC's ANALYSIS SUMMARY\n",
    "\n",
    "OBJECTIVE:\n",
    "- Analyze the parallelization implemented for the XGBoost Algorithm in Amazon SageMaker. Two implementations tested:\n",
    "    - XGBoost as a framework\n",
    "    - XGBoost as a built-in algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "BASED ON:\n",
    "- xgboost_abalone_dist_script_mode.ipynb from amazon-sagemaker-examples\n",
    "- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/xgboost.html\n",
    "\n",
    "MODIFICATIONs:\n",
    "- data_split() to prodcue 4 files each with up to 10 times more data than original file and additionaly copy-duplicated to produce final 32 files for GPU testing\n",
    "- adding TRAIN TIME INSIDE.PY for XGBoost as a framework to bring time.measuremnt as close to the training step as possible\n",
    "\n",
    "METHODOLOWGY:\n",
    "- confirmation of parallelization is provided by the execution time measures with expectation that the stronger node and the higher level of parallelization the shorter execution time\n",
    "\n",
    "- the desired time measure would caputere only time spent on training and exclude any time spent on instance initial data download and any output generation and instance closing - not all measures guarantee it but not all measures are available in all scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "- there are up to 3 time measures used inthe analyses\n",
    "    - TRAIN TIME OUTSIDE\n",
    "        - Execution time of the .fit() method - generally, it provides very little differentiation in the recorded time due to capturte of time required to start and stop the EC2 instances.\n",
    "    - TRAIN TIME INSIDE.PY OR \"@tracker xx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx secs between node start and job finish\"\n",
    "        - those measures are intended to capture only the time behind excution of the XGBoost algorithm\n",
    "        - TRAIN TIME INSIDE.PY is available for the IN FRAMEWORK tests and it does exclude any initial data preparation and closing seps from measuremnt\n",
    "        - \"@tracker xx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx secs between node start and job finish\" available for IN ALGORITHM tests but it seems to also cover soem data preparation and output generation steps in measurements thus those valus are not comperabel with the earlier measure\n",
    "            - this measre is not avaibale for single instance tests ?!?!?!??!\n",
    "    - Billable seconds: 592/4\n",
    "        - this is inernal AWS measure. it seems to capture well the effects of parallelization. On the surface, its values are contrary to expectaitons (i.e. increasing parallelization usually increases its value. This is so as it measures sum of Billable seconds accross all runnig instances. Thus the final measure is the average execution time per insance: Billable Secouds / Number of Instances. On this level, increaing the insance count does lead to the shorter execution time per instance. But this measure also captures time spent on data and output preparation.\n",
    "        \n",
    "- It would be best to implment the equivalent of TRAIN TIME INSIDE.PY measure for the built-in algorithm but this requires creation of a custom container which is not the objective of this work\n",
    "\n",
    "FINDINGS:\n",
    "- General\n",
    "    - Both XGBoost framework and built-in algorithm provide positive effects of parallelization\n",
    "        - in theis analysis, it is not possibel to say which approach is more effcient due to the mix of availabel measures andinclusion in some of them of external elements to the actual model traing.\n",
    "    - for clearest impact it is important to work with higher sample sizes thus increase in file sizes and their number.\n",
    "    - No \"Pipe\" Input-Data mode testing as it seems not to work with LIBSVM format.\n",
    "    - Data Sharding provides beneffits in multi instance training. the effect might be present also w???!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!*&^*&^*&%*%*&%&%%*%&&*%**%*^$*$#%#*%^#*\n",
    "    \n",
    "- XGBoost as a FRAMEWORK\n",
    "    - both update of the instance and increase of its count speeds up training.\n",
    "        - the effect is most visible between 1 and 2 insstances. it flattens when edding more instances but this is possibly due to the still low sample sizes  \n",
    "    - training pn GPUs has strong possitive effect possibly even in terms of cost-efficiency\n",
    "        - training on instance with 8 GPUs does not provide farhter speed-up. This can be due two factors:\n",
    "            - to small data\n",
    "            - framework implementation utilizes only single GPU per instance thus we can parallelize GPU execution only withmultiple instances -- requires further research\n",
    "            - data and output preparation takes significnat portion of the execution time with available sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- XGBoost as a built-in ALGORITH\n",
    "    - Same results as for the FRAMEWORK\n",
    "    - \"FastFile\" InputData mode - slower but possibly due to the small sample sizes\n",
    "    - Multi-GPU training indicates some speed-up but it is dificult to say if this is due to the stronger GPU type or due to parallization. the week effect can be attrubted to still too-small sample size.\n"

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of Amazon SageMaker XGBoost to train and host a regression model. [XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting)](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io) is a popular and efficient machine learning (ML) algorithm used for regression and classification tasks on tabular datasets. It implements a technique know as gradient boosting on trees, and performs remarkably well in ML competitions, and gets a lot of attention from customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the [Abalone dataset](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/regression.html), originally from the [UCI ML repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone). In this libsvm converted version, the nominal feature (Male/Female/Infant) has been converted into a real valued feature as required by XGBoost. The age of the abalone snail is predicted from eight physical measurements.  \n",

    "---\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was tested in Amazon SageMaker Studio on a ml.t3.medium instance on the Python 3 (Data Science) kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by specifying:\n",
    "1. The S3 bucket and prefix to use for the training and model data. This should be within the same region as the Notebook Instance, training, and hosting.\n",
    "1. The IAM role ARN used to grant access to your data."

    "SageMaker can now run an XGBoost script using the XGBoost estimator. When run on SageMaker, a number of helpful environment variables are available to access properties of the training environment, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `SM_MODEL_DIR`: A string representing the path to the directory to write model artifacts to. Any artifacts saved in this folder are uploaded to S3 for model hosting after the training job completes.\n",
    "- `SM_OUTPUT_DIR`: A string representing the filesystem path to write output artifacts to. Output artifacts may include checkpoints, graphs, and other files to save, not including model artifacts. These artifacts are compressed and uploaded to S3 to the same S3 prefix as the model artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "When two input channels, `train` and `validation`, are used in the call to the XGBoost estimator's `fit()` method, the following environment variables are set, following the format `SM_CHANNEL_[channel_name]`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `SM_CHANNEL_TRAIN`: A string representing the path to the directory containing data in the 'train' channel.\n",
    "- `SM_CHANNEL_VALIDATION`: Same as above, but for the 'validation' channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical training script loads data from the input channels, configures training with hyperparameters, trains a model, and saves a model to the `model_dir` so that it can be hosted later. Hyperparameters are passed to your script as arguments and can be retrieved with an `argparse.ArgumentParser` instance.
