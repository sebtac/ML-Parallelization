# ML-Parallelization

Collecton of tests of parallelization of data collections and ML Trainig in various platforms and applications. It includes:
  - XGBoost on Ray (XGBoost with Ray.ipynb)
  - XGBoost on RAY and MODIN (XGBoost with RAY and MODIN - OOM DATA.ipynb)
    - with Pandas
    - with Modin
    - with SharedRayDMatrix with (parquet) - AWS, OOM Dataset
    - OOM Test
      - with RAY, MODIN, AWS
      - Partially Successfull!
  - XGBoost on AWS (xgboost_abalone_dist_script_mode-ST.ipynb)
    - with AWS's Framework
    - with AWS's Built-In Algorithm
    - with AWS's Built-In Algorithm and PIPE MODE to address OOM Error - TBC
